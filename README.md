eCommerce Transactions Dataset

...Overview...
This repository contains the solution to a Data Science assignment focused on analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset. The project showcases skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and clustering to provide actionable business insights.

...Objectives...
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Develop a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
Implement Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers with similar behaviors.

...Dataset Description...
The dataset consists of three files:
1.Customers.csv
Includes customer details such as ID, name, region, and signup date.

2.Products.csv
Contains product details such as ID, name, category, and price.

3.Transactions.csv
Records transaction details such as transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, date, quantity, and total value.


...Tasks... 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze the dataset for trends, correlations, and anomalies.
Provide at least five business insights.

2. Lookalike Model
Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers for each customer based on profile and transaction history.
Use similarity scores to rank recommendations.

3. Customer Segmentation
Perform customer clustering using profile and transaction data.
Evaluate clusters with metrics like DB Index and visualize results.
